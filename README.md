# Fasting App

A Kinotic isomorphic TypeScript project. Entities are plain TypeScript classes, and
the Kinotic CLI turns them into typed repository classes you can use from both server
and client code.

## Layout

```
.config/kinotic.config.ts     Project config (organization, application, entity paths)
packages/domain/index.ts      Package entry — export your entities and repositories here
packages/domain/model         Entity classes you write
packages/domain/repositories  Repository classes generated from those entities
packages/microservices/main   Starter microservice (zone setup + connect)
packages/ui                   User interfaces
```

## Getting started

```bash
bun install
```

The Kinotic CLI is installed as a dev dependency, so no global install is required.

## Working with entities

1. Write an entity under `packages/domain/model`. Decorate the class with `@Entity`
   and mark its identifier with `@Id`:

   ```ts
   import { Entity, Id } from '@kinotic-ai/persistence'

   @Entity()
   export class Customer {
     @Id
     public id: string = ''
     public name: string = ''
   }
   ```

2. Generate the repository classes:

   ```bash
   bun run generate
   ```

   This writes `packages/domain/repositories/CustomerRepository.ts` along with
   `packages/domain/repositories/generated/BaseCustomerRepository.ts`. Edit the
   `CustomerRepository` class to add your own logic — the `Base*` classes under
   `generated/` are overwritten on every run.

3. Type check your work:

   ```bash
   bun run type-check
   ```

4. Commit and push. Kinotic OS reads entity definitions from the connected GitHub
   repository and synchronizes them for you, so there is nothing to log in to or push
   from your machine.

## Microservices and UI packages

Each microservice or UI is its own workspace package nested under
`packages/microservices/` or `packages/ui/`. The starter service at
`packages/microservices/main` shows the shape — copy it for additional services:
a `package.json` that depends on the domain package with
`"@fasting-app/domain": "workspace:*"`, a `tsconfig.json` extending
`tsconfig.base.json`, and an entry registered in `bunup.config.ts`. Inside this
repository the domain package resolves to its TypeScript source (the `development`
and `bun` export conditions), so imports type-check and run without a prior build;
consumers that install it from a registry get the built `dist/` output instead.

For production, build a microservice into a single-file executable from its package
directory:

```bash
bun build --compile src/main.ts --outfile bin/<service-name>
```

This bundles the service together with the domain package's TypeScript source, so no
prior domain build is needed. Use `bun build --compile` directly for executables:
bunup's `compile` option currently drops an import binding when bundling the Kinotic
client libraries and produces a binary that crashes on startup.

## Scripts

| Script                | Description                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run generate`    | Generate repository classes from `@Entity` classes        |
| `bun run type-check`  | Type check every package in the workspace                 |
| `bun run build`       | Build all packages with bunup                             |
| `bun run dev`         | Build all packages in watch mode                          |

`build` and `dev` need each package to have an entry point that bunup can find
(for example `packages/domain/index.ts`) before they produce any output.
